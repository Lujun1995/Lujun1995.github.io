 Something about Me
 </font>
 
Hi! I'm Jun Lu, a first-year master student in biostatistics at Columbia Univerisity. I'm learning many interesting and useful biostatistical courses during my master program, such as *Data Science I & II*, *Biostatistical Methods I & II* and *Statistical Inference*. I'm also learning *machine learning* and *deep learning* by myself.

In the future,  I want to start my career as a biostatistician or a statistician.

 Something about This Website
 </font>

I'm trying to summarize what I have learnt and what I have done and put some of them on this website. However, I'm still working on it, so there are a lot of blank space on this site now. After completing, you can see many projects and homework I have done before here. 

Hope the information on this website could help you know me better.
